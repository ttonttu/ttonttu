- 👋 Hi, I’m @ttonttu, or more officially Tiina. 🇫🇮
- 👀 I’m interested in whatever the life throws at my general direction.
- 🤯 I’m currently learning Python, GCP, and not losing my mind with coding (not necessarily in this order).
- 📫 I'm easily reached by telepathy or, say, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiina-vistbacka-184223224/">LinkedIn</a>.
- ⭐ When I grow up (and/or old), I'm going to write an epic adventure book. Or game. Or gaming book. We'll see!
